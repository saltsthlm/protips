# Save your fingers - lesson 2 - Visual Studio Code

We are programmers. We type a lot. Let's save our fingers and make the precious keystrokes we do count!

We've given you a brand new (for most of you, I presume) code editor - Visual Studio Code. It's a very powerful tool and right now in lead of the preferred editors for JavaScript developers.

The trait of a really good editor is that you never need to use the mouse. Everything (!) has a keyboard shortcut, that you could and should use.

The full map (https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) is horrendously large and I know noone that knows all of these. But you should know a few commands to simplify your everyday life.

Here are my top 10:

1. **⌘S** Save current file  and **⌥⌘S** to Save All open documents
1. **⌘W** Close current file(window)
1. **⌘P** Goto file dialog
1. **⇧⌥F** format document (fixes indentation etc)
1. **⌘F** Find stuff and **⌥⌘F** to replace the stuff you found
1. **⌘C** copies selected text OR entire line, **⌘X** cuts it
1. **⌥↓ / ⌥↑** - move line up or down
1. **⇧⌥↓ / ⇧⌥↑** copies line up or down
1. **⌃`** - shows the integrated terminal
1. **⌘B** - toggles the sidebar (with all the files etc) visibility

In the list above:

* ⌘ is the command key
* ⌥ - means alt/option-key
* ⇧ is the Shift-key
* ⌃ is the control-key
